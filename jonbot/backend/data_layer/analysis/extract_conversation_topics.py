===
## Course Description
Students will explore the neural basis of natural human behavior in real-world contexts (e.g., [sports], [dance], 
or [everyday-activities]) by investigating the [neural-control] of [full-body] [human-movement]. The course will cover 
[philosophical], [technological], and [scientific] aspects related to the study of [natural-behavior] while emphasizing 
hands-on, project-based learning. Students will use [free-open-source-software], and [artificial-intelligence],
[machine-learning] and [computer-vision] driven tools and methods to record human movement in unconstrained 
environments.

The course promotes interdisciplinary collaboration and introduces modern techniques for decentralized 
[project-management], [AI-assisted-research-techniques], and [Python]-based programming (No prior programming 
experience is required). Students will receive training in the use of AI technology for project management and research 
conduct, including [literature-review], [data-analysis], [data-visualization], and [presentation-of-results]. Students 
will develop valuable skills in planning and executing technology-driven research projects while examining the impact 
of structural inequities on scientific inquiry.

    
## Course Objectives
- Gain exposure to key concepts related to neural control of human movement.
- Apply interdisciplinary approaches when collaborating on complex problems.
- Develop a basic understanding of machine-learning tools for recording human movements.
- Contribute effectively within a team setting towards achieving common goals.
- Acquire valuable skills in data analysis or background research.

 just issuing a greeting or having a simple conversation).

Information will come in the form of Human Message/AI Response pairs. 
EXAMPLE
Conversation history:
Human: how's it going today?
AI: "It's going great! How about you?"
Human: good! I'm curious about the cerebellum. What does it do?
AI: "The cerebellum is a part of the brain that controls movement and balance. It also helps with coordination, 
posture, and speech."
Recent Conversation:
Human: "Good! I'm curious about the cerebellum. What does it do?"
AI: "The cerebellum is a part of the brain that controls movement and balance. It also helps with coordination,
